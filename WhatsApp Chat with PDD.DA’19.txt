As one Metro Vancouver transit union gets set to escalate its strike action, another is taking a strike vote, adding to the potential for chaos for local commuters.

CUPE 7000 represents about 900 SkyTrain workers and announced Tuesday a strike vote is underway for its members.

A statement from CUPE said the B.C. Rapid Transit Company, which operates SkyTrain on behalf of TransLink, turned down its latest proposal for new bargaining dates, setting off the strike vote.

1/9/20, 5:12 PM - Ved DA Langara: Any developments?
1/9/20, 5:13 PM - Naval DA Langara: He said give her some time, it’s been only 2 classes, she is also teaching this for the first time
1/9/20, 5:14 PM - Naval DA Langara: And speak to her what r the changes you would want to see in class
1/9/20, 5:14 PM - Naval DA Langara: I told her she doesn’t seem approachable
1/9/20, 5:15 PM - Naval DA Langara: He was like, give it a try, if you approach and it doesn’t work out let me know
1/9/20, 5:16 PM - Naval DA Langara: I asked him, if he or any other faculty could come and sit in the class, just to see d way she teaches
1/9/20, 5:16 PM - Naval DA Langara: We spoke for around 40 mins, but I doubt there is going to be any change
1/9/20, 5:17 PM - Ved DA Langara: What’s her name? Lol
1/9/20, 5:17 PM - Kiran DA: Naval Michael won't help in this I guess
1/9/20, 5:18 PM - Naval DA Langara: Emma
1/9/20, 5:18 PM - Kiran DA: Emma qi
1/9/20, 5:18 PM - Ved DA Langara: He’s the only one who can bhai

1/9/20, 5:18 PM - Kiran DA: We can speak with department chair
1/9/20, 5:19 PM - Ved DA Langara: Let’s try one more class. If it doesn’t work out, we’ll talk to Michael again.
1/9/20, 5:19 PM - Naval DA Langara: Even I was thinking the same thing
1/9/20, 5:19 PM - Kiran DA: Our department chair will be in c block superior to Michael
1/9/20, 5:20 PM - Naval DA Langara: This also sounds good
1/9/20, 5:22 PM - Naval DA Langara: There were 2 things he which stuck with me:
1- speak to her directly as that would be the fastest way to get a solution, if we keep going inderectly, it will cause chaos, it won’t help the situation
1/9/20, 5:22 PM - Ved DA Langara: Let’s not take Michael out of the picture. We need to deal with him on a daily basis, better keep him in loop.
1/9/20, 5:23 PM - Naval DA Langara: 2: it’s just been 2 classes, so just see where it goes, because her content preparation is good, I haven’t seen the content, so I couldn’t argue with that😅😅
1/9/20, 5:26 PM - Tuli Data Analytics Langara: Even her presentation 😒
1/9/20, 5:28 PM - Naval DA Langara: I haven’t seen dat yet, so I guess we can check that, and approach Michael again
1/9/20, 5:28 PM - Ved DA Langara: Try asking her a question, you’ll realize the prep is shit.

*Ministry of health’s emergency notification to the public that the Coronavirus influenza outbreak this time is very very serious & fatal. There's no cure once you are infected.*
*Its spreading from China to various countries*

*Prevention method is to keep your throat moist, do not let your throat dry up. Thus do not hold your thirst because once your membrane in your throat is dried, the virus will invade into your body within 10 mins.*
*Drink 50-80cc warm water, 30-50cc for kids, according to age.* *Everytime u feel your throat is dry, do not wait, keep water in hand.* *Do not drink plenty at one time as it doesn’t help, instead continue to keep throat moist.*
*Till end of March 2020, do not go to crowded places, wear mask as needed especially in train or public transportation* *Avoid fried or spicy food and load up vitamin C.*
*The symptoms/ description are*
*1.repeated high fever*
*2.prolonged coughing after fever*
*3.Children are prone*
*4.Adults usually feel uneasy,*headache and mainly respiratory related*
*5: highly contagious*🚨
Pls share if you care for human life!🙏😇

2/4/20, 5:02 PM - Harshad DA Langara: Done. 👍
2/4/20, 10:11 PM - Amir DA: Guys I just had to say this. Remember Khurram Shehzad used a famous junkyard tornado example as reason for atheism dismissal: the chance that a tornado sweeping through a junkyard might assemble a Boeing 747. This is just a fallacy as metal scraps won't attach to each other if smashed but carbon and hydrogen atoms, among others, do. Look up "primordial soup" entry in Wikipedia. Sorry folks but I can't take fallacy :)

2/5/20, 7:45 PM - Ved DA Langara: Such a “Wannabe”
2/5/20, 7:57 PM - Roberta DA Langara: She doesn't know what is a robust regression

2/5/20, 10:59 PM - Naval DA Langara: Today's CPSC Lab
2/5/20, 11:00 PM - Naval DA Langara: what does it mean, having interactive plot???
2/5/20, 11:00 PM - Naval DA Langara: We should be able to change values on the go???
2/5/20, 11:00 PM - Naval DA Langara: <Media omitted>
2/5/20, 11:01 PM - Dharun Canada DA: No, interactive plots are the ones that allow you to zoom, pan and show values when you run your cursor over it
2/5/20, 11:01 PM - Dharun Canada DA: you should be able to interact with the plot, but you won't be able to change the values in any way
2/5/20, 11:02 PM - Dharun Canada DA: there are 2 ways:
2/5/20, 11:02 PM - Dharun Canada DA: if you are using matplotlib then  use the line "%matplotlib notebook"
2/5/20, 11:03 PM - Dharun Canada DA: and then write the code for your plot then you will get it.
2/5/20, 11:03 PM - Dharun Canada DA: There is another way that i saw some of our classmates use, but i am not sure how that works.
2/5/20, 11:03 PM - Naval DA Langara: Cool thanks👍
2/5/20, 11:04 PM - Dharun Canada DA: GGs
2/5/20, 11:04 PM - Naval DA Langara: I was thinking about reading about Bokeh library🙄🙄
2/5/20, 11:08 PM - Kania DA Langara: i was thinking plotly 😅
2/5/20, 11:08 PM - Kania DA Langara: too complicated
2/5/20, 11:11 PM - Naval DA Langara: Thanks bro, it worked on 1st try
2/5/20, 11:11 PM - Naval DA Langara: I'll search later how we can actually interact😅😅
2/5/20, 11:16 PM - Naval DA Langara: This message was deleted
2/5/20, 11:26 PM - Dharun Canada DA: Yeah, this method is pretty straight forward. Only drawback is that you can have both the static and interactive plots at a time. It's either this or that.

2/7/20, 9:06 AM - Roberta DA Langara: Does anyone have a merely idea how to use that Latin in the assignment1 of cpsc
2/7/20, 10:06 AM - Dharun Canada DA: I was going to suggest Google translate for some reason... 
But then I actually did some digging, there are a set of encoding built-in
2/7/20, 10:07 AM - Dharun Canada DA: And latin-1 and latin-2 are part of these encoding methods.
2/7/20, 10:08 AM - Dharun Canada DA: So all you will have to do is.. 
Wherever you insert the file name add this to it. ( FileName, encoding = 'latin-x')
2/7/20, 10:08 AM - Dharun Canada DA: Sorry for the late reply
2/7/20, 10:11 AM - Roberta DA Langara: Tks Dharun

2/10/20, 7:23 PM - Dharun Canada DA: @12368883428 what did Khuram say about the "pie" question?
2/10/20, 7:23 PM - Edward DA Langara: Great question
2/10/20, 7:23 PM - Edward DA Langara: I will clarify it tonight
2/10/20, 7:23 PM - Dharun Canada DA: Hahaha...
2/10/20, 7:24 PM - Dharun Canada DA: Oh great...
2/10/20, 9:36 PM - Dharun Canada DA: Does anyone know how to get the R²a for 4.88.. from the DANA assignment 2
2/10/20, 10:53 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: R u talking about 4.88(f)?
2/10/20, 10:57 PM - Edward DA Langara: R² ?!🤔
2/10/20, 10:58 PM - Kania DA Langara: Isnt that just adjusted r-square? Isn't that in the R output?
2/10/20, 11:00 PM - Amir DA: I could not find it ir SAS regression output for that question either
2/10/20, 11:00 PM - Roberta DA Langara: there is no output in the book for that question
2/10/20, 11:00 PM - Roberta DA Langara: so I think we have to run the model
2/11/20, 6:54 AM - Dharun Canada DA: I'm using sas and I'm not able to find that in SAS
2/11/20, 6:55 AM - Dharun Canada DA: SAS output only gives R² and not adj-R²
2/11/20, 8:10 AM - Roberta DA Langara: Gives you adjusted R
2/11/20, 8:10 AM - Dharun Canada DA: Wait, what?
2/11/20, 8:53 AM - Vasu DA Lanagara: Yes everytime you have this in output
2/11/20, 9:02 AM - Roberta DA Langara: On the glm procedure we don't have adjusted r square just the regular
2/11/20, 9:02 AM - Roberta DA Langara: And we should use glm
2/11/20, 9:03 AM - Roberta DA Langara: Because is a quadratic regression
2/11/20, 9:03 AM - Roberta DA Langara: But with the regular one you can get the adjusted
2/11/20, 9:34 AM - Arshpreet Singh Lanagar DA: sometimes i feel 
i am in the wrong group
🤯
2/11/20, 9:35 AM - Roberta DA Langara: Sometimes I feel that I'm in the wrong course

2/11/20, 9:39 AM - Tuli Data Analytics Langara: I think about this everyday
2/11/20, 12:58 PM - jaspreet singh: in this python assignment
2/11/20, 12:58 PM - jaspreet singh: <Media omitted>
2/11/20, 12:59 PM - jaspreet singh: we need to explicitly convert data to percentages or there is some function for that
2/11/20, 1:00 PM - Dharun Canada DA: (100*df['bla bla'].value_counts()[0]) / df.count()
2/11/20, 1:01 PM - jaspreet singh: ok we need to do it by ourself :( Thanks

2/11/20, 3:32 PM - Dharun Canada DA: I heard it is not increasing for PDD
2/11/20, 3:32 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: I think we have more credits next semester
2/11/20, 3:33 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: Not because of tuition increase

2/11/20, 5:35 PM - Amir DA: how does he know my name?!
2/11/20, 5:36 PM - Amir DA: or anybody’s?!
2/11/20, 5:36 PM - Arshpreet Singh Lanagar DA: you mailed him for midterms
2/11/20, 5:37 PM - Amir DA: I didn’t attach a picture of me to that email 😄
2/11/20, 5:53 PM - Arshpreet Singh Lanagar DA: Then be happy
you are famous!
2/11/20, 5:57 PM - Amir DA: 😄
2/11/20, 9:26 PM - Dharun Canada DA: Yeah...so I figured out how to do this. Incase anyone is still wondering. By using "GLM" you only get R² and getting Adj-R² from R² using formula is too mainstream. 
But if you create a new column 'cost2 = cost*cost' and then run "proc reg", you will get adj-R².
2/11/20, 9:27 PM - Roberta DA Langara: you have to use glm Dharum
2/11/20, 9:27 PM - Roberta DA Langara: actually for the first one does not make difference
2/11/20, 9:27 PM - Roberta DA Langara: but the last one that you have several predictors make
2/11/20, 9:28 PM - Dharun Canada DA: Yeah for the other things yes..
2/11/20, 9:28 PM - Dharun Canada DA: But if you only need Adj-R² then go with this approach.
2/11/20, 9:28 PM - Roberta DA Langara: If you want to use glm procedure and get the adjusted r quared
2/11/20, 9:28 PM - Roberta DA Langara: this is the syntax
2/11/20, 9:29 PM - Roberta DA Langara: proc glmselect data=naval plot=CriterionPanel;
model percent = cost cost2
/ selection=forward(select=SL) stats=all;
run;
2/11/20, 9:29 PM - Ved DA Langara: I’m just using Linear Regression function from the task panel. Any ideas on that? 😅
2/11/20, 9:34 PM - Beth DA: proc reg data = NAVALBASE_new;
     model percent = cost cost2; inter cost2;
     F_partial: test cost2;
run;
2/11/20, 9:35 PM - Beth DA: i got adj r2 for this code.. not sure if i am right
2/11/20, 9:36 PM - Ved DA Langara: If you use RStudio, you’ll get adj-R square
2/11/20, 9:36 PM - Beth DA: I use SAS
2/11/20, 9:37 PM - Ved DA Langara: No wonder companies are getting rid of SAS
2/11/20, 9:42 PM - Ved DA Langara: <Media omitted>
2/11/20, 9:46 PM - Dharun Canada DA: I hope we *all* figure out a way to crack the midterm the same way we did this one.🤞🏼

2/22/20, 10:00 AM - jaspreet singh: solution to part c ?, thanks in advance :)
2/22/20, 11:12 AM - Kiran DA Langara: the model for which slope is more negative
2/22/20, 11:12 AM - Kiran DA Langara: coz more negative slope means less stress
2/22/20, 11:12 AM - Kiran DA Langara: nd more strength
2/22/20, 11:16 AM - jaspreet singh: ok
2/22/20, 11:19 AM - Ved DA Langara: Hoop Pine
2/22/20, 11:20 AM - Ved DA Langara: Greater value of y-intercept means that fatigue resistence is higher when the bladr cycles are 0
2/22/20, 11:21 AM - Ved DA Langara: *blade
2/22/20, 11:23 AM - jaspreet singh: now i am confused
2/22/20, 11:24 AM - Kiran DA Langara: along y we have fatigue...but in qus they r talking about fatique resistant
2/22/20, 11:24 AM - Kiran DA Langara: resistant means less stress
2/22/20, 11:24 AM - Kiran DA Langara: ☺☺
2/22/20, 11:32 AM - Ved DA Langara: ‘y’ is the value of stress the blade can take. It reduces as with the increase in blade cycles, hence a negative beta1.
2/22/20, 11:32 AM - Ved DA Langara: *reduces with

2/22/20, 2:27 PM - Ved DA Langara: :P
2/22/20, 2:28 PM - Ved DA Langara: Because the individual y values vary more than the mean of y and production interval takes into account all those variations, not just the ones about the mean

(tell me if i am wrong)
2/23/20, 9:54 PM - Arshpreet Singh Lanagar DA: partial*
2/23/20, 9:54 PM - Arshpreet Singh Lanagar DA: @16047219059 ?
2/23/20, 9:57 PM - Ved DA Langara: Should be by individual t-test
They wanna test independent usefulness
2/23/20, 9:58 PM - Ved DA Langara: Second by partial f-test
2/23/20, 9:58 PM - Arshpreet Singh Lanagar DA: 🤯
2/23/20, 9:59 PM - Ved DA Langara: That’s what I think :P
We’re probably gonna have a lot of different answers from everyone tomorrow
2/23/20, 9:59 PM - Arshpreet Singh Lanagar DA: i read conducting individual t is not a good approach so use partial f 
somewhere
2/23/20, 9:59 PM - Arshpreet Singh Lanagar DA: 😕
2/23/20, 10:00 PM - Tuli Data Analytics Langara: Nice
2/23/20, 10:00 PM - Tuli Data Analytics Langara: Thankyou:)

b) Partial F test
2/23/20, 10:17 PM - Vasu DA Lanagara: C is model writing

3/15/20, 6:37 PM - David Vazquez Data Analytics: @12366688900 Walmart seems pretty stocked up and with reasonable prices. 

You could get rice, canned beans, canned soups, powder milk, cereal/granola, snack bars, cooking oil, tuna cans, canned chicken (hard to find nowadays), toiletries needed, sauces if you want to mix with your rice and stuff haha 

I think people might be a bit over panicking but I understand if some want to be over prepared if we go on a city wide lockdown. Who knows if that would happen though. 

Good luck shopping.

3/16/20, 9:00 PM - Cici DA Langara: Any one got same result for chunks and whole df in task 5?
3/16/20, 9:01 PM - Ved DA Langara: Not supposed to be the same
3/16/20, 9:01 PM - Cici DA Langara: What about task6?
3/16/20, 9:01 PM - Ved DA Langara: Working on it
3/16/20, 9:02 PM - Ved DA Langara: About Task 5, make sure you do it in the way he’s specified. There’s a much easier and shorter code to do the same thing, but he wants us to create and append a list for some reason...
3/16/20, 9:03 PM - Cici DA Langara: I got different result again in task 6🤦🏻‍♀️
3/16/20, 9:03 PM - Cici DA Langara: I know...
3/16/20, 9:03 PM - Cici DA Langara: Why we have to create list first🤦🏻‍♀️
3/16/20, 9:03 PM - Ved DA Langara: I don’t get this guy. So weird.
3/16/20, 9:04 PM - Cici DA Langara: Maybe he just want to test you how to create list and then append it
3/16/20, 9:07 PM - Ved DA Langara: Bring it on lol
3/16/20, 9:20 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: Maybe its also spposed to be diffeent?
3/16/20, 9:20 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: For task 6?
3/16/20, 9:22 PM - Ved DA Langara: Don’t know yet
3/16/20, 10:40 PM - Dharun Canada DA: You have to get different results for Df and the chucks
3/16/20, 10:40 PM - Dharun Canada DA: For both task 5 & 6 it has to be different.
3/16/20, 10:40 PM - Dharun Canada DA: And his following questions does not ask if they are the same..
3/16/20, 10:41 PM - Dharun Canada DA: They ask if you agree with what you see and how to avoid the difference.
3/16/20, 10:42 PM - Ved DA Langara: Are you sure? Concatenating the chunks and then getting value counts for string columns works perfectly, but I'm not sure what he wants man
3/16/20, 10:42 PM - Dharun Canada DA: breaking the data into chunks to read in the data is a good method to import data. But using the dataset as chunks is bound to give faulty answers.
3/16/20, 10:42 PM - Dharun Canada DA: That is what he is trying to teach us, indirectly.
3/16/20, 10:43 PM - Dharun Canada DA: In both the cases, increasing the chunk size or  merging them all together can improve the accuracy of the results.
3/16/20, 10:43 PM - Dharun Canada DA: This is what I know. And I think this makes sense.
3/16/20, 10:44 PM - Kiran DA: This message was deleted
3/16/20, 10:44 PM - Kiran DA: Yes ved
3/16/20, 10:44 PM - Dharun Canada DA: And I am not going to change my code cuz it's 1 mark in a 10 mark assignment which has a 0.06% value...
3/16/20, 10:44 PM - Dharun Canada DA: Which means this 1 mark is 0.006%>
3/16/20, 10:44 PM - Dharun Canada DA: !*
3/16/20, 10:45 PM - Dharun Canada DA: So I am done trying to understand his Christopher Nolan genre questions.
3/16/20, 10:45 PM - Dharun Canada DA: 🎤
3/16/20, 10:45 PM - Rashman DA: 😅😅
3/16/20, 10:49 PM - Naval DA Langara: U sure for 5??
Because it says-
'Display the number of columns for each unique data type found.'
Irrespective of the fact, you are dealing with full dataframe or chunk. 
Both should have same number of columns for each unique data type.
3/16/20, 11:38 PM - Ved DA Langara: Emma's crazy. On her email, she said assignment 4 is due on Thursday. And now she's updated the due-date on Brigthspace to Wednesday evening.

3/17/20, 12:57 PM - Roberta DA Langara: Or 3
3/17/20, 12:58 PM - Jasman DA Lanagara: I definitely don’t want to go with any written thing, she’ll find thousands of errors😂
3/17/20, 12:58 PM - David Vazquez Data Analytics: I think 4 is easier
3/17/20, 12:59 PM - Ved DA Langara: You create one presentation and record voiceovers for your part. Then merge all the voiceovers and align it with your presentation. Too much work.
3/17/20, 1:05 PM - Naval DA Langara: I think option 4 is easiest, just create a ppt

3/17/20, 4:58 PM - David Vazquez Data Analytics: Dharun just to give you an idea, the financial melt down is worse than in 2008 and the news aren't talking about it because they are focusing all over the virus spread. The financial aftermath is looking not very good

3/18/20, 2:14 PM - jaspreet singh: in last question DANA assignment we need to remove two outlier or one
3/18/20, 2:17 PM - Kania DA Langara: i removed 2
3/18/20, 2:17 PM - jaspreet singh: ok
3/18/20, 2:24 PM - Roberta DA Langara: I removed one
3/18/20, 2:30 PM - jaspreet singh: so in both cases we are rejecting null hypothesis
3/18/20, 2:30 PM - jaspreet singh: means I am rejecting null in both
3/18/20, 2:32 PM - Roberta DA Langara: With outlier reject
3/18/20, 2:32 PM - Roberta DA Langara: Without outlier fail to reject
3/18/20, 2:33 PM - jaspreet singh: but if we remove both outlier
3/18/20, 2:33 PM - jaspreet singh: rejects null in both cases
3/18/20, 2:33 PM - Roberta DA Langara: Have to check but I don't think so
3/18/20, 2:36 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: Only 31
3/18/20, 2:36 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: Is outlier
3/18/20, 2:36 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: @12363340235
3/18/20, 2:36 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: I think lol
3/18/20, 2:37 PM - jaspreet singh: box plot there are two right
3/18/20, 2:37 PM - Roberta DA Langara: I just excluded 31
3/18/20, 2:41 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: <Media omitted>
3/18/20, 2:41 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: they didnt consider -13 to be a significant outlier
3/18/20, 2:41 PM - Roberta DA Langara: <Media omitted>
3/18/20, 2:42 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: really?
3/18/20, 2:42 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: so -13 is also an outlier?
3/18/20, 2:42 PM - Roberta DA Langara: <Media omitted>
3/18/20, 2:43 PM - Roberta DA Langara: So @17788855554  @12363340235  giving the nature of the question I think It does make difference the outlier and you should remove only 31
3/18/20, 2:44 PM - Roberta DA Langara: Doesn't make any sense reject in both answers
3/18/20, 2:44 PM - Kania DA Langara: Oh I just based it on boxplot
3/18/20, 2:45 PM - Kania DA Langara: I alr submitted it so 🤷
3/18/20, 2:46 PM - jaspreet singh: hmm
3/18/20, 3:08 PM - Roberta DA Langara: should be reject with outlier

3/19/20, 12:44 AM - David Vazquez Data Analytics: Once it starts taking off in India, mexico, and Africa we will see a lot of people suffer
3/19/20, 12:45 AM - Kania DA Langara: It's not going to work~ the virus spreads thru the vents etc. That's why they installed negative air pressure rooms for outbreaks.. idk what the govt are thinking
3/19/20, 12:45 AM - Ved DA Langara: Oh no, it’s not airborne. It spreads through droplets and touch.
3/19/20, 12:46 AM - Kania DA Langara: Yeah but will the person really stay at home?
3/19/20, 12:46 AM - Kania DA Langara: Who can guarantee? Who's gonna get food for them?
3/19/20, 12:47 AM - Ved DA Langara: That’s the whole point. What about people who don’t have a home!
3/19/20, 12:47 AM - David Vazquez Data Analytics: It actually can stay in the air for a  while

https://nypost.com/2020/03/17/who-recommends-airborne-precautions-after-coronavirus-found-to-survive-in-air/
3/19/20, 12:47 AM - Kania DA Langara: But the virus stays in your room UNLESS they disinfect it twice a day. So even if they recover, they can still get infected again if it's not properly disinfected
3/19/20, 12:48 AM - Ved DA Langara: Yes, only the droplets in the close area they were released in. Doesn’t spread through air. That’s why 6 feet distance!
3/19/20, 12:48 AM - Kania DA Langara: Yeap. Hk suspected that too when the whole apartment was infected after one person was tested positive. Then again it could be them touching contaminated surfaces
3/19/20, 12:49 AM - David Vazquez Data Analytics: Nations have no other option than to keep their people in as much isolation and closing people businesses
3/19/20, 12:49 AM - Ved DA Langara: Just stay safe and isolated guys. Go to work only if it doesn’t involve contact with people and take all precautions.
3/19/20, 12:50 AM - Kania DA Langara: Yeap 😭
3/19/20, 12:50 AM - David Vazquez Data Analytics: We're headed into a global recession. Never a dull moment for us.
3/19/20, 12:51 AM - Ved DA Langara: Sadly India has less jails for that. And most people aren’t really taking precautions, considering they believe it’s China’s revenge against US 😅
3/19/20, 12:51 AM - David Vazquez Data Analytics: I'm already tired of staying home haha and it's been only a few days... Haha
3/19/20, 12:51 AM - Kania DA Langara: I love it!!
3/19/20, 12:52 AM - Kania DA Langara: 😂
3/19/20, 12:52 AM - David Vazquez Data Analytics: So much speculation going around. Very dangerous
3/19/20, 12:52 AM - David Vazquez Data Analytics: Financial Post: Oil just hit $25 a barrel, that’s a 17-year low, as demand collapses on coronavirus demand.

3/19/20, 12:52 AM - Kania DA Langara: But I'd much prefer to be in Singapore right now..
3/19/20, 12:52 AM - Ved DA Langara: Leave groceries, stock up on oil.
3/19/20, 12:52 AM - David Vazquez Data Analytics: Haha so much for coming back on time after spring break
3/19/20, 12:52 AM - David Vazquez Data Analytics: Haha and gold
3/19/20, 12:53 AM - Ved DA Langara: People are actually planning to and expanding their investment portfolios right now, lol
3/19/20, 12:54 AM - Kania DA Langara: Hahah
3/19/20, 12:54 AM - Kania DA Langara: Everything is so cheap now!
3/19/20, 12:54 AM - Kirra DA LANGARA: Buy your stocks when it hits rock bttm
3/19/20, 12:54 AM - Kania DA Langara: But it will keep going down
3/19/20, 12:55 AM - David Vazquez Data Analytics: Yes. Plan to retire early hahaha
3/19/20, 12:55 AM - Kania DA Langara: Until a vaccine is developed...
3/19/20, 12:55 AM - Ved DA Langara: Though if things get worse, we could be looking at global recession
3/19/20, 12:56 AM - Kania DA Langara: I thought we at the point worst than the IMF 2008?
3/19/20, 12:56 AM - David Vazquez Data Analytics: Oh Vedant. At this point is inevitable. The Rock has just hit the water . Wait for the waves
3/19/20, 12:56 AM - Kania DA Langara: Financial crisis I mean
3/19/20, 12:57 AM - Ved DA Langara: I read so too, but not sure the extent to which it’s true
3/19/20, 12:57 AM - David Vazquez Data Analytics: So bad. The plunge is as bad if not even worse (and it's not over yet) AND so much more debt everywhere AND dozens of industries are being mutilated right now
3/19/20, 12:58 AM - David Vazquez Data Analytics: All at the same time
3/19/20, 12:58 AM - David Vazquez Data Analytics: Which was not the case in 2008
3/19/20, 12:58 AM - Ved DA Langara: Netflix and Zoom Meetings will surely make tons of money
3/19/20, 12:58 AM - David Vazquez Data Analytics: And toilet paper companies haha
3/19/20, 12:59 AM - Kirra DA LANGARA: Like i said recession is bad news for international students
3/19/20, 1:00 AM - Kirra DA LANGARA: Recession = Less Jobs = Less permanent residency visas
3/19/20, 1:00 AM - David Vazquez Data Analytics: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/business/stock-market-coronavirus-federal-reserve.html
3/19/20, 1:02 AM - David Vazquez Data Analytics: Yes, there's a lot of uncertainty with immigration. But think about it, you have very good skills that the Canadian government wants new immigrants to have
3/19/20, 1:02 AM - Kirra DA LANGARA: Hopefully, ill try to be optimistic
3/19/20, 1:03 AM - David Vazquez Data Analytics: Let's hope for the best.
3/19/20, 1:04 AM - Ved DA Langara: But if we somehow avoid recession and international travel opens but stays limited, that means faster PR approvals for candidates already in Canada.
3/19/20, 1:04 AM - David Vazquez Data Analytics: Yes, the government will try to do that by hitting the okay button and printing more money into the economy. Haha.
3/19/20, 1:05 AM - Ved DA Langara: Hahah agreed
3/19/20, 1:05 AM - David Vazquez Data Analytics: I think you guys will have an edge when applying because of your skills
3/19/20, 1:06 AM - Ved DA Langara: New Job Role = Covid-19 Analyst
3/19/20, 1:06 AM - Kirra DA LANGARA: We can form a regression model
3/19/20, 1:07 AM - David Vazquez Data Analytics: 😂
3/19/20, 1:08 AM - Kirra DA LANGARA: Use median age as predictor
3/19/20, 1:08 AM - Kirra DA LANGARA: As well as percentage of people with blood type A
3/19/20, 1:09 AM - David Vazquez Data Analytics: Probably the data will satisfy all assumptions haha
3/19/20, 1:10 AM - David Vazquez Data Analytics: Oh yes, people, very careful:

3/19/20, 1:14 AM - Roberta DA Langara: Sometimes I feel kinda panicking
3/19/20, 1:14 AM - Kirra DA LANGARA: <Media omitted>
3/19/20, 1:14 AM - Roberta DA Langara: Then I chill a little then panic  again
3/19/20, 1:15 AM - David Vazquez Data Analytics: Yes, it is hard to be doing online courses and having so many distractions around ... Like the news and family elsewhere.
3/19/20, 1:16 AM - David Vazquez Data Analytics: Definately an unprecedented challenge for many students all across the country

3/19/20, 1:20 AM - David Vazquez Data Analytics: Yes, although very worrisome how they have lowered the interest rates to almost 0% and they injecting a 1trillion dollars pretty soon here. A bubble might be bursting
3/19/20, 1:20 AM - David Vazquez Data Analytics: Haha just very interesting to see the comparison
3/19/20, 1:22 AM - David Vazquez Data Analytics: Another worrisome thing is the crime. Crisis time = desperation = crime where there's a lot of corruption

*RESEARCH: JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY, APRIL 1991, PAGE 1916*

All we need to do, to beat corona virus, we need to take more of an alkaline foods that are above the above pH level of the Virus. 

Some of which are:
Lemon - 9.9pH
Lime - 8.2pH
Avocado - 15.6pH
Garlic - 13.2pH
Mango - 8.7pH
Tangerine - 8.5pH
Pineapple - 12.7pH

3/27/20, 6:31 PM - Jasman DA Lanagara: The person who is working from 5 months 20 hours per week, would have made 5k dollars

3/27/20, 10:25 PM - Amir DA: The government will provide a taxable benefit of $2,000 a month for up to 4 months to:

workers who must stop working due to COVID19 and do not have access to paid leave or other income support.
workers who are sick, quarantined, or taking care of someone who is sick with COVID-19.
working parents who must stay home without pay to care for children that are sick or need additional care because of school and daycare closures.
workers who still have their employment but are not being paid because there is currently not sufficient work and their employer has asked them not to come to work.
wage earners and self-employed individuals, including contract workers, who would not otherwise be eligible for Employment Insurance.
3/27/20, 10:27 PM - Amir DA: There is no mention of the prior amount of x dollars earned to be eligible.
3/27/20, 10:27 PM - Beth DA: true
3/27/20, 10:28 PM - Beth DA: CERB might be exclusive for canadians only
3/27/20, 10:29 PM - Amir DA: I read it from this page: https://www.cfs-fcee.ca/what-students-need-to-know-about-the-federal-governments-covid-19-economic-response-plan/
3/27/20, 10:30 PM - Amir DA: From Mai: I am an international student. I have worked at the same workplace for more than two years. I got laid off last week. On the government website, eligible claimants are those who have immigrant’s status and have work permit. Does it include student visa as well?
3/27/20, 10:30 PM - Amir DA: A: CERB applies to any resident of Canada who is 15 years old and has earned at least $5000 from: employment, self-employment, EI maternity benefits or EI parental benefits. You should apply.
3/27/20, 10:31 PM - Amir DA: this is from a lawyer mentioning international students directly
3/27/20, 10:31 PM - Beth DA: good to hear... I hope so..
3/27/20, 10:31 PM - Amir DA: the second one actually does mention the 5000 dollars
3/27/20, 10:32 PM - Beth DA: I don't qualify...
3/27/20, 11:10 PM - Manoj DA Langara: Who qualifies?

The CERB covers *Canadians* who have lost their job, are sick, quarantined, or taking care of someone who is sick with COVID-19, as well as working parents who must stay home without pay to care for children because of school or daycare closures.

It also applies to anyone who was laid off and qualifies for EI. But unlike EI, it also applies to people who don’t, such as freelancers, contractors and people still technically employed but no longer receiving income due to the pandemic.

To qualify, applicants must have had $5,000 in employment income, self-employment income, or maternity or parental leave benefits for 2019 or in the 12-month period preceding the day they make the application.

So basically, it’s designed to fill any gaps left by existing income support programs when it comes to people who’ve lost work because of COVID-19.
3/27/20, 11:10 PM - Manoj DA Langara: It says Canadian 😐
3/27/20, 11:49 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: Does anyone know if IE is open?

3/31/20, 4:49 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: Yeah a lot of people used online calculator for the last midterm instead of tables from her
3/31/20, 4:53 PM - Edward DA Langara: actually if she allow us to use R, we can get the same result from online calculator
3/31/20, 4:53 PM - Edward DA Langara: <Media omitted>

3/31/20, 4:57 PM - Edward DA Langara: she said that F 0.025,25,28 is similar to F 0.025,24,28
3/31/20, 4:58 PM - Edward DA Langara: approximate
3/31/20, 4:58 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: Yeah i guess but in class she said to give the range so i assumed it was between df 24 and 30
3/31/20, 4:59 PM - Edward DA Langara: i think it is fine to use range or approximation in this question
3/31/20, 5:02 PM - Edward DA Langara: Hi All,

I kept waiting for you guys on Zoom to show up for today's class.

However, it looks like you guys were expecting that the class would take place on Wednesday just like last week.

If that's the case, let's do the lecture tomorrow at 4:30 PM. We will have one more lab after this and then we would be done with the course outline.

See you guys tomorrow. The Zoom meeting ID is the same as before, i.e. 988-105-6838.

Best wishes.

4/2/20, 7:13 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: we are not the only international students in this college

4/2/20, 7:15 PM - Arshpreet Singh Lanagar DA: yeah
4/2/20, 7:15 PM - Jasman DA Lanagara: 😠
4/2/20, 7:15 PM - Prerna Malik , Langara DA: They're anyway going to save so much of infrastructural costs this semester
4/2/20, 7:15 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: so there is 6300 international students in langara
4/2/20, 7:16 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: 140k divided by 6300

4/2/20, 7:22 PM - jaspreet singh: is very small sample set
4/2/20, 7:22 PM - jaspreet singh: Michael said it is the IE department who needs to fix this fees thing
4/2/20, 7:24 PM - Aditi Jaswal Langara DA Canada: Let's give a try.. anyway we have to pay the exact amount but a little try won't hurt..
4/2/20, 7:24 PM - Arshpreet Singh Lanagar DA: Still 18 days to go
That’s why i insist we write to them ASAP
so they have fair amount of time to think and respond

4/2/20, 7:29 PM - Vasu DA Lanagara: Arsh write a email.

4/2/20, 7:29 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: yes i know
4/2/20, 7:29 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: i am just curious how much they got
4/2/20, 7:29 PM - Arshpreet Singh Lanagar DA: nearly 50
architecture frnds
4/2/20, 7:29 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: ok good
4/2/20, 7:29 PM - Arshpreet Singh Lanagar DA: on it!
4/2/20, 7:29 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: i can buy a new printer
4/2/20, 7:29 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: since library is closed now haha
4/2/20, 7:31 PM - Vasu DA Lanagara: Why you need printer?
4/2/20, 7:31 PM - Beth DA: we can still print at lib, at no cost...
4/2/20, 7:32 PM - Beth DA: I tried, printed a lot at 0$
4/2/20, 7:32 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: i have to travel 90 minutes just to print though
4/2/20, 7:35 PM - Vasu DA Lanagara: Not a bad deal
4/2/20, 7:40 PM - Arshpreet Singh Lanagar DA: As we all know, it is a hard time for everyone especially the international students who have become hand to mouth in lieu of COVID19.

We have limited amount of funds with hardly any savings available and seeing unpromising current situation and the time to come, It would be really hard for us to pay the entire fee this term. 

Moreover as Langara has made it’s decision to go online for the summer term, it is my humble request on behalf of our batch PDD Data Analytics (Fall 2019) that a considerable fee waiver is offered for this term. 

It will be fair as students would no longer be using the infra services during this term and they will just be accessing study material online.

Kindly do the needful! It would mean a lot.
Thankyou for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
4/2/20, 7:40 PM - Arshpreet Singh Lanagar DA: Editing Omitting welcomed
4/2/20, 7:42 PM - jaspreet singh: looks good

4/2/20, 7:44 PM - Arshpreet Singh Lanagar DA: yes and without sarcasm this time😅😝
4/2/20, 7:44 PM - Amir DA: My english is poor. what's " in lieu" in that text? 😄
4/2/20, 7:44 PM - Vasu DA Lanagara: hahahaha.....
4/2/20, 7:50 PM - Arshpreet Singh Lanagar DA: oops weongly used
it should be as a result of 
instead
4/2/20, 7:50 PM - Amir DA: Greedy bastards as they are, they will most probably decline any fee wavering. So we could add at the end of the letter something like this: If the aforementioned request is not possible, please at least consider putting off the registration fee for later when everything's back in order.
4/2/20, 7:51 PM - Arshpreet Singh Lanagar DA: awesome👏🏼
4/2/20, 7:55 PM - Arshpreet Singh Lanagar DA: but if they think of a waiver lets say
then we r giving them option 
not to 🤔
4/2/20, 7:55 PM - Aditi Jaswal Langara DA Canada: Yeah I feel the same
4/2/20, 7:56 PM - Arshpreet Singh Lanagar DA: Once it is declined 
then we can mail back this request
4/2/20, 7:56 PM - Aditi Jaswal Langara DA Canada: We can give this option if they deny
4/2/20, 7:56 PM - Aditi Jaswal Langara DA Canada: Yeah exactly
4/2/20, 7:56 PM - Amir DA: clever
4/2/20, 7:56 PM - Arshpreet Singh Lanagar DA: 🙏🏼

4/3/20, 2:35 PM - Amir DA: This week, you received an email from the College letting you know about a new NG grade and alternate grading for this semester.  We understand that you may have many questions around this and how it may affect you.
4/3/20, 2:35 PM - Amir DA: what's NG grading?
4/3/20, 2:36 PM - Roberta DA Langara: No Grade = NG
4/3/20, 2:36 PM - jaspreet singh: i believing if we are going to fail in a cource we can request for No Grade , instead of F grade
4/3/20, 2:36 PM - Roberta DA Langara: basically if you fail a course
4/3/20, 2:36 PM - Roberta DA Langara: hey well put NG instead of your actual grade
4/3/20, 2:36 PM - Roberta DA Langara: then your GPA is not affected

4/4/20, 9:27 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: Haha
4/4/20, 9:27 PM - Navjot DA: 😂😂
4/4/20, 9:27 PM - Cici DA Langara: you are typing too much words?
4/4/20, 9:27 PM - Vasu DA Lanagara: If we do something on laptop, is there any chance that she would know abt it?
4/4/20, 9:27 PM - Roberta DA Langara: The sad part is that I'll need to change I can't stay on camera in my pjs
4/4/20, 9:27 PM - Navjot DA: Exactly
4/4/20, 9:27 PM - Cici DA Langara: I don't think so
4/4/20, 9:28 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: Nope
4/4/20, 9:28 PM - Cici DA Langara: also we have to look at each other's face through the whole exam
4/4/20, 9:28 PM - Cici DA Langara: it will make me laugh
4/4/20, 9:29 PM - Roberta DA Langara: Actually don't because I'll stay looking to my word
4/4/20, 9:29 PM - Roberta DA Langara: And let the zoom minimized
4/4/20, 9:29 PM - Vasu DA Lanagara: Then, I must say..she is so innocent😂
4/4/20, 9:29 PM - Cici DA Langara: a lot of instructor did this
4/4/20, 9:30 PM - Cici DA Langara: i guess she just want you to know that she is watching you
4/4/20, 9:30 PM - Rashman DA: Some people have internet issues too 🙄🙄
4/4/20, 9:30 PM - Ved DA Langara: She can piss off.
4/4/20, 9:31 PM - Amir DA: The big brother is watching you comrade
4/4/20, 9:33 PM - Amir DA: She put so much unwanted stress on me this term and she continues to do so up until this very last moment. Just can’t take it anymore.
4/4/20, 9:33 PM - Tuli Data Analytics Langara: yeah
4/4/20, 9:34 PM - Harshad DA Langara: <Media omitted>
4/4/20, 9:35 PM - Cici DA Langara: Highly agree
4/4/20, 9:39 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: What if ur laptop doesnt have a camera haha 🤣
4/4/20, 9:39 PM - Tuli Data Analytics Langara: exactly
4/4/20, 9:39 PM - Tuli Data Analytics Langara: hahah
4/4/20, 9:48 PM - Arshpreet Singh Lanagar DA: zoom runs in same browser
so cookies wl b shared
4/4/20, 9:49 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: ?
4/4/20, 9:49 PM - Aditi Jaswal Langara DA Canada: 😣
4/4/20, 9:50 PM - Arshpreet Singh Lanagar DA: i mean if anybody googles
4/4/20, 9:50 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: But i use the zoom app
4/4/20, 9:50 PM - Arshpreet Singh Lanagar DA: i am assuming this 🤔
4/4/20, 9:50 PM - Jasman DA Lanagara: Yeah
4/4/20, 9:50 PM - Harshad DA Langara: 😂😂
4/4/20, 9:50 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: Not browser based
4/4/20, 9:50 PM - Harshad DA Langara: We reject your hypothesis
4/4/20, 9:51 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: And conclude that zoom does not share cookies with emmap
4/4/20, 9:51 PM - Arshpreet Singh Lanagar DA: even through app it launches in browser no?
4/4/20, 9:51 PM - Harshad DA Langara: No
4/4/20, 9:51 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: Well she gave link
4/4/20, 9:51 PM - Cici DA Langara: she is going to check our cookies?
4/4/20, 9:52 PM - Arshpreet Singh Lanagar DA: she is insane
4/4/20, 9:52 PM - Arshpreet Singh Lanagar DA: she ll go to any extent
4/4/20, 9:52 PM - Naval DA Langara: I think zoom keeps cookie data for their analysis of users, it cannot share cookies data, with other users
4/4/20, 9:52 PM - Ved DA Langara: She can’t do it without written consent. That’s the law.
4/4/20, 9:53 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: We can sue langara if that happens
4/4/20, 9:53 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: Make some dollars
4/4/20, 9:53 PM - Cici DA Langara: yeah, i am thinking the same. It's our privacy
4/4/20, 9:53 PM - Ved DA Langara: Nope, you’ll be suing both Zoom and Langara
4/4/20, 9:53 PM - Naval DA Langara: Lol, i want to sue Emma individually😅😅
4/4/20, 9:53 PM - Aditi Jaswal Langara DA Canada: 🤣🤣
4/4/20, 9:53 PM - Ved DA Langara: Dollars X 2
4/4/20, 9:53 PM - Arshpreet Singh Lanagar DA: And if we google anything, zoom wl not be exited ?
4/4/20, 9:54 PM - Ved DA Langara: Nope. Runs in the background.
4/4/20, 9:54 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: I am wondering if she meant d2l lock
4/4/20, 9:54 PM - Ved DA Langara: Otherwise how do plan to work on your exam
4/4/20, 9:54 PM - Arshpreet Singh Lanagar DA: woth camera on
4/4/20, 9:54 PM - Ved DA Langara: *do you
4/4/20, 9:54 PM - Ved DA Langara: Yes
4/4/20, 9:55 PM - Ved DA Langara: You can do whatever you want on your laptop, just can’t talk and stuff
4/4/20, 9:55 PM - Cici DA Langara: she wants us to mute our self
4/4/20, 9:55 PM - Cici DA Langara: even we are talking
4/4/20, 9:55 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: Wait she said cant use the internet
4/4/20, 9:55 PM - Ved DA Langara: But then again, it’s an open book exam. How does she plan to limit our head tilts...
4/4/20, 9:55 PM - Cici DA Langara: she can't hear us
4/4/20, 9:55 PM - Harshad DA Langara: We can wear a mask 😂
4/4/20, 9:55 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: Means we can turnoff our wifi
4/4/20, 9:56 PM - Ved DA Langara: Hahaha
4/4/20, 9:57 PM - Cici DA Langara: then zoom will only show your profile photo to her
4/4/20, 9:57 PM - Roberta DA Langara: The only thing that intrigued me is that she said before open book and now no internet
4/4/20, 9:58 PM - Roberta DA Langara: I'll just open zoom on firefox and my exam I can google it stuff on google chrome
4/4/20, 9:59 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: But she said no internet.. using zoom is technically using the internet we can argue with her that way...
4/4/20, 9:59 PM - Roberta DA Langara: Then I skip the cookies problem
4/4/20, 9:59 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: Is there really a cookies issue
4/4/20, 9:59 PM - Roberta DA Langara: But I don't think she's really check this
4/4/20, 9:59 PM - Roberta DA Langara: And even if this is possible shareable with her
4/4/20, 10:00 PM - Roberta DA Langara: Because there's privacy issues regarding this right?
4/4/20, 10:00 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: Imma try and click on the link now
4/4/20, 10:02 PM - Tuli Data Analytics Langara: it seems like usual meeting
4/4/20, 10:02 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: Yeah its like a normal meetinng
4/4/20, 10:03 PM - Jasman DA Lanagara: What if she asks us to share screen
4/4/20, 10:03 PM - Tuli Data Analytics Langara: only one can do at a time
4/4/20, 10:03 PM - Jasman DA Lanagara: No
4/4/20, 10:03 PM - Jasman DA Lanagara: Multiple participants can share at the same time
4/4/20, 10:03 PM - Tuli Data Analytics Langara: and i dont think she wants class to see answers
4/4/20, 10:04 PM - Jasman DA Lanagara: <Media omitted>
4/4/20, 10:04 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: Then we can use 2 laptops
4/4/20, 10:04 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: 1 laptop will be the screen share and the other laptop will be the non screen share one... where we can google
4/4/20, 10:05 PM - Roberta DA Langara: But she will see you moving from one laptop to another
4/4/20, 10:05 PM - Roberta DA Langara: I kust think that you guys are overthinking this
4/4/20, 10:06 PM - Amir DA: run separate zoom with the person you want to cheat with and silently share screens
4/4/20, 10:06 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: If we screenshare she can only see the screenshare not camera
4/4/20, 10:07 PM - Jasman DA Lanagara: Can a person share screen and camera simultaneously on zoom?
4/4/20, 10:07 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: Not sure about this if someone has experience lmk
4/4/20, 10:07 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: I dont think so though
4/4/20, 10:08 PM - Roberta DA Langara: She'll not ask you to screenshare
4/4/20, 10:08 PM - Tuli Data Analytics Langara: if we share the screen ppl can see their paper
4/4/20, 10:08 PM - Tuli Data Analytics Langara: its not practical
4/4/20, 10:08 PM - Jasman DA Lanagara: 😂😂😂
4/4/20, 10:08 PM - Roberta DA Langara: The thing that bothered her is that people communicate
4/4/20, 10:08 PM - Roberta DA Langara: She will watching in zoom
4/4/20, 10:08 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: 🤣
4/4/20, 10:08 PM - Jasman DA Lanagara: Only Emma can see
4/4/20, 10:08 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: I forgot about this
4/4/20, 10:08 PM - Roberta DA Langara: Just to make sure that you're not talking to anyone
4/4/20, 10:09 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: You can also creats a video loop of urself
4/4/20, 10:09 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: Create*
4/4/20, 10:10 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: So she thinks its u lol but its just a video loop haha
4/4/20, 10:10 PM - Tuli Data Analytics Langara: hahahah
4/4/20, 10:10 PM - Roberta DA Langara: Study will be lesser work than create a loop video
4/4/20, 10:10 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: 👆
4/4/20, 10:10 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: True that
4/4/20, 10:11 PM - Navjot DA: If we will share our screens then we are able to see everyone's answer right?
4/4/20, 10:11 PM - Navjot DA: Because we will work in word
4/4/20, 10:11 PM - Amir DA: what’s the overall minimum grade to pass?

4/17/20, 9:34 AM - Amir DA: and vagueness of the final questions. apart from these, it was not "that different" from his labs in terms of difficulty

4/17/20, 9:35 AM - Amir DA: and we could not simply move on from q1
4/17/20, 9:36 AM - Roberta DA Langara: And if you don't get question one right you don't have the df_detail that is needed to do the other questions properly
4/17/20, 9:37 AM - Amir DA: yeah, my point exactly. you needed that for the whole test.
4/17/20, 9:37 AM - Naval DA Langara: Also the memory issue

4/17/20, 9:46 AM - Vasu DA Lanagara: No, but as per his email, he figured out the problem...😅
4/17/20, 9:48 AM - Amir DA: similar frame of thoughts here 😄😄😄
4/17/20, 9:49 AM - Naval DA Langara: That too some Donald guy did, Michael had emailed him yesterday😅😅
4/17/20, 9:50 AM - Amir DA: Hi Amir,

I’ve only replied to a handful of students in your cohort, hoping that they will share this info to everybody in your cohort. Could you help me do that?

- Please understand that I cannot do overrides for BUSM courses. The Business Department Chair has to do it.

- Both the Business Dept Chair and I are fully aware of this situation. He will give you a different type of override soon (I don’t know when). But when he does, you will get another email notification. Then you can try register for the course again.

- Meanwhile, there is no point to keep trying (as the status has been changed).

- Thanks for your patience.

Michael

4/21/20, 6:47 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: Since the highest grade is an A, I would be adding some marks to your final scores, so that even those with a C- should get a C, which is the minimum requirement subsequently. - Kurram
4/21/20, 6:48 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: Since the highest grade is an A, I would be adding some marks to your final scores, so that even those with a C- should get a C, which is the minimum requirement subsequently. - Khurram

4/21/20, 7:12 PM - Roberta DA Langara: It supposed to be
4/21/20, 7:12 PM - Roberta DA Langara: But I've never learn about someone failing because this rule
4/21/20, 7:12 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: Dont worry about it
4/21/20, 7:12 PM - Roberta DA Langara: And he said that he improved the grades
4/21/20, 7:12 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: He only cares about overall
4/21/20, 7:13 PM - Naval DA Langara: I hope so
4/21/20, 7:14 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: As long as ur overall grade is 55% u will pass
4/21/20, 7:34 PM - Niki DA Langara: Anyone has Khurram phone number? I need to call him as he added wrong grades for me
4/21/20, 7:40 PM - Kania DA Langara: Same... You guys might wanna double check his calculation
4/21/20, 7:41 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: Which one?
4/21/20, 7:41 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: Did he particularly miscalculate?
4/21/20, 7:41 PM - Kania DA Langara: CPSC overall
4/21/20, 7:41 PM - Kania DA Langara: Idk if it's rounding error?
4/21/20, 7:43 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: He hasnt done overall grade?
4/21/20, 7:43 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: Yet
4/21/20, 7:43 PM - Niki DA Langara: I mean final exam grade
4/21/20, 7:43 PM - Kania DA Langara: Oh right.. I mixed up overall grade and final grade 🙊
4/21/20, 7:43 PM - Kania DA Langara: Sorry for confusion
4/21/20, 7:44 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: Dont look at the letter grade he put in the right side
4/21/20, 7:45 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: Just look at the points
4/21/20, 7:45 PM - Niki DA Langara: Yes I did
4/21/20, 7:46 PM - Niki DA Langara: I mean I received B+ 24/35 but as what he wrote in his annoucement I should have A- 27/35. So I think it is typing mistake
4/21/20, 7:47 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: ohh A- is supposed to be the overall grade
4/21/20, 7:47 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: The highest grade A also goes to Chin Yin Chiu, so many many congratulations once again!!!

The next spot A- is shared by Amir Targholizadeh, Nhu Nguyen, and Vedant Mayor, so many congratulations to you guys as well!
4/21/20, 7:47 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: ^^^ he is talking about overall grade in this one
4/21/20, 7:48 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: so he will bump you up from A- to A
4/21/20, 7:48 PM - Niki DA Langara: Uhm yes it makes sense
4/21/20, 7:49 PM - Ved DA Langara: The grades are calculated by the system. Khurram only puts in the scores. Just make sure your scores and totals are correct.
4/21/20, 7:51 PM - Ved DA Langara: He most likely won’t. I think that marks increase offer was only for those who got a lesser grade than C. But I hope I’m wrong.
4/21/20, 7:53 PM - Vasu DA Lanagara: Do Khurram update overall grade?
4/21/20, 7:53 PM - Niki DA Langara: Yes I think I misunderstand between overall score and final score
4/21/20, 7:53 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: he said he will add for everyone
4/21/20, 7:53 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: no but u can calculate your score
4/21/20, 9:22 PM - Vasu DA Lanagara: Do you get chance to call khurram?
4/21/20, 11:23 PM - Niki DA Langara: No I dont have his number
4/22/20, 12:14 AM - Kirra DA LANGARA: He added 3% to everyone

5/2/20, 10:33 AM - Ved DA Langara: Hi guys! Hope you're all doing well and are safe during these times.

The preceding batch did us a favor by estalishing the Data Analytics Club and we thank them for it. Now that they've graduated, it's up to us to take it forward. Luckily, we have been able to maintain an active status for our club this semester and would be working on conducting online events - webinars, calls, peer tutoring and other knowledge sharing sessions, etc. We would also be working creating a club website and relevant content.

For this to happen, we need a core team to be put in place starting with a vote to choose the new Club President, who would undertake major responsibilities of decision making, setting up core team, club management, sponsor management, event management and further sharing responsibilities, etc. A unanimous vote seems to be the best way of doing so. Anyone who'd like to nominate themselves for the position can submit their names here on the group by 12pm today. Once I have all the nominations, I will create an online form for voting and forward it to everyone. Voting will commence at 3pm and end at 5pm. Please make sure that all votes are submitted within the stated time frame. We hope that everyone participates since it's for our own benefit.

Thanks.
5/2/20, 1:23 PM - Ved DA Langara: Looks like no one wants to be president :P

5/19/20, 3:40 PM - Roberta DA Langara: does not make sense to pay

3) We reduce the dimensionality by selecting the largest eigen values.

5/21/20, 5:36 PM - Roberta DA Langara: why this data set the pca dimension stuff she input the data
5/21/20, 5:36 PM - Roberta DA Langara: what I suposed to do with this
5/21/20, 5:37 PM - Roberta DA Langara: I have to do pca in this data set
5/21/20, 5:37 PM - Roberta DA Langara: ok got it
5/21/20, 5:37 PM - Dharun Canada DA: What's PCA
5/21/20, 5:38 PM - Naval DA Langara: +1
5/21/20, 5:38 PM - Kirra DA LANGARA: +1
5/21/20, 5:38 PM - Dharun Canada DA: The code file is empty right?

6/9/20, 7:06 PM - Roberta DA Langara: I think she has the idea of giving us a hard time to make us better
6/9/20, 7:06 PM - Roberta DA Langara: but you need to be reasonable

6/23/20, 5:02 PM - Roberta DA Langara: like there's a bunch of things of internet but the conclusions are hers
6/23/20, 5:02 PM - Roberta DA Langara: definitely

6/24/20, 11:51 AM - jaspreet singh: I need some help, It says loading bokeh but no graph is showing up
6/24/20, 11:51 AM - jaspreet singh: I tried restarting my system , any clue ?
6/24/20, 11:52 AM - Amir DA: it should change to “successfully loaded”
6/24/20, 11:52 AM - jaspreet singh: ok
6/24/20, 11:53 AM - jaspreet singh: This means it is taking time to load in my machine
6/24/20, 11:53 AM - Amir DA: maybe
6/24/20, 11:53 AM - jaspreet singh: any other alternatives to this approach
6/24/20, 11:54 AM - Ved DA Langara: Try running
BOKEH_RESOURCES = inline

before output_notebook()
6/24/20, 11:55 AM - Ved DA Langara: If that doesn’t work

from bokeh.resources import INLINE
import bokeh.io
bokeh.io.output_notebook(INLINE)
6/24/20, 11:56 AM - jaspreet singh: <Media omitted>
6/24/20, 11:56 AM - jaspreet singh: anyone have seen this before
6/24/20, 11:58 AM - Amir DA: have you added all the imports he mentioned in the pdf?
6/24/20, 11:58 AM - jaspreet singh: yes yes
6/24/20, 11:59 AM - Ved DA Langara: import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from bokeh.layouts import row, widgetbox
from bokeh.models import ColumnDataSource, HoverTool, Slider, CategoricalColorMapper
from bokeh.plotting import show, figure, output_file
from bokeh.palettes import Spectral6
from bokeh.io import output_notebook, curdoc
output_notebook()
6/24/20, 11:59 AM - jaspreet singh: will try again

6/24/20, 1:37 PM - Dharun Canada DA: Oh you started already, gimme sometime
6/24/20, 1:37 PM - jaspreet singh: no hurry when you are done with this slider :)
6/24/20, 2:39 PM - jaspreet singh: <Media omitted>
6/24/20, 3:18 PM - Vasu DA Lanagara: Yes, his name is KHURRAM
6/24/20, 3:34 PM - Amir DA: This is what I found out from internet: Bokeh widgets like sliders don't work in jupyter notebooks (at least, not without using some javascript).
6/24/20, 3:35 PM - Amir DA: It seems we can't simply use the way he has mentioned in his pdf
6/24/20, 3:36 PM - Vasu DA Lanagara: True/
6/24/20, 3:36 PM - Amir DA: the function must be a javascript-ish style:
6/24/20, 3:36 PM - Amir DA: slider.callback = CustomJS(
    args=dict(source_visible=source_visible,
              source_available=source_available), code="""
        var selected_function = cb_obj.value;
        // Get the data from the data sources
        var data_visible = source_visible.data;
        var data_available = source_available.data;
        // Change y-axis data according to the selected value
        data_visible.y = data_available[selected_function];
        // Update the plot
        source_visible.change.emit();
    """)
6/24/20, 3:37 PM - Amir DA: The method he describes in the PDF, far as I figured out, can only be run in a bokeh server command
6/24/20, 3:38 PM - Naval DA Langara: Yup
6/24/20, 3:38 PM - Amir DA: It maybe a good idea to ask him to demonstrate it himself
6/24/20, 3:38 PM - Naval DA Langara: But cannot show output in notebook
6/24/20, 3:38 PM - Naval DA Langara: it displays in html
6/24/20, 3:39 PM - Naval DA Langara: also port number 5006 should be free
6/24/20, 3:39 PM - Naval DA Langara: Because this file gets deployed only in that port
6/24/20, 3:39 PM - Amir DA: 👍
6/24/20, 3:39 PM - Amir DA: I hope Jas is satisfied now
6/24/20, 3:40 PM - Amir DA: Let's hope he doesn't ask for a slider in the exam 🙌
